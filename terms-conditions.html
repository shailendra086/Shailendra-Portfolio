            <p class="mt-3">Some states do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties or limitation of liability for incidental or
                consequential damages, which means that some of the above limitations may not apply. In these states,

            <h2 class="common-heading">"AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" Disclaimer</h2>
            <p class="mt-3">The Service is provided to You "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" and with all faults and defects without
                warranty of any kind. To the maximum extent permitted under applicable law, the Company, on its own
                behalf and on behalf of its Affiliates and its and their respective licensors and service providers,
                expressly disclaims all warranties, whether express, implied, statutory or otherwise, with respect to
                the Service, including all implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose,
                title and non-infringement, and warranties that may arise out of course of dealing, course of
                performance, usage or trade practice. Without limitation to the foregoing, the Company provides no
                warranty or undertaking, and makes no representation of any kind that the Service will meet Your
                requirements, achieve any intended results, be compatible or work with any other software, applications,
                systems or services, operate without interruption, meet any performance or reliability standards or be
                error free or that any errors or defects can or will be corrected.</p>
            <p class="mt-3">Without limiting the foregoing, neither the Company nor any of the company's provider makes any
                representation or warranty of any kind, express or implied: (i) as to the operation or availability of
                the Service, or the information, content, and materials or products included thereon; (ii) that the
                Service will be uninterrupted or error-free; (iii) as to the accuracy, reliability, or currency of any
                information or content provided through the Service; or (iv) that the Service, its servers, the content,
                or e-mails sent from or on behalf of the Company are free of viruses, scripts, trojan horses, worms,

            <p class="mt-3">Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain types of warranties or limitations on applicable
                statutory rights of a consumer, so some or all of the above exclusions and limitations may not apply to
                You. But in such a case the exclusions and limitations set forth in this section shall be applied to the
                greatest extent enforceable under applicable law.</p>
            <h2 class="common-heading">Governing Law</h2>

                international laws.</p>

            <p class="mt-3">You represent and warrant that (i) You are not located in a country that is subject to the United States
                government embargo, or that has been designated by the United States government as a "terrorist
                supporting" country, and (ii) You are not listed on any United States government list of prohibited or
                restricted parties.</p>
            <h2 class="common-heading">Severability and Waiver</h2>
            <h3 class="common-heading">Severability</h3>
            <p class="mt-3">If any provision of these Terms is held to be unenforceable or invalid, such provision will be changed

            <p class="mt-3">Except as provided herein, the failure to exercise a right or to require performance of an obligation
                under these Terms shall not affect a party's ability to exercise such right or require such performance
                at any time thereafter nor shall the waiver of a breach constitute a waiver of any subsequent breach.
            </p>
